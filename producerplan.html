							<h3>Reputation, Ranks, and Levels</h3>
							<p>
								We will be using a “point” system. In a team, for each member that completes the 3 tasks and is verified by the Metrics Trackers, the team will earn a point, which will be tallied by the Metrics Trackers in a table in the Official Tour Document. The participants will be able to see in the table which members have completed the tasks. They will also be able to see a live update of the number of points each team has. The Tour Conductor will also periodically update the participants with verbal notifications of the point statuses of each team - for example, “All right, it looks like Red Team is in the lead with 4 points, with Green Team following close behind with 3 points!” - this will give participants a sense of their progress during the tour, and it will also serve as a source of motivation to make their team be in the lead. 
							</p>

							<h3>Parallel Communication</h3>
							<p>
								We intend to communicate with each other via a separate Google Hangouts group. During the tour, we will continuously keep in contact with each other through this Google Hangouts group and with the rest of the class as they are working through the tasks by staying live in Sococo - we will also periodically give feedback through Sococo to the class about each team’s progress. After the tour, we will maintain our Google Hangouts group to debrief on the tour, discuss how it went, and also discuss what we could have done to improve.
							</p>

							<h3>Brand</h3>
							<p>
								Our website uses the imagery and colors associated with and from the Club Penguin website. The Club Penguin website utilizes “cool” toned colors that are associated with wintry themes and penguins, such as shades of blue, white, and black. These images and colors blend both our website and the 3D virtual world of Club Penguin together, which assists in making the experience of viewing our website more immersive by making it seem like it is a part of the actual 3D world of Club Penguin to the users, and that it is more like they are in an extension of Club Penguin itself.
