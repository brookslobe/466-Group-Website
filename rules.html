							    <h3>1. Do not throw snowballs at other players' penguin avatars without their consent.</h3>
							    <img src="images/rule1.png" alt="" >
							    <p>Club Penguin users should be considerate and respectful of other penguins when in the same virtual area as them. Throwing snowballs at other penguins without their consent can be seen as unkind and disrespectful of another player’s avatar and personal space and may negatively influence their experience in the club penguin virtual world.</p>
							</div>​

							<div class="content">
							    <h3>2. Don’t stand directly on, or cover up other penguins.</h3>
							    <img src="images/rule2.png" alt="" >
							    <p>Not only is it a breach of personal space, but users will be unable to see what their penguin is doing until they move to a new spot.  Furthermore, there could potentially be pathing issues that hinder someone even if they try to move.</p>

							<div class="content">
							    <h3>3. Refrain from using obscene or hurtful language in chat.</h3>
							    <img src="images/rule4a.png" alt="" >
							    <p>Whenever inappropriate language is used in Club Penguin, the chat is filtered, and the user is greeted with a pop-up reminding them of the rules.</p>

							<div class="content">
							    <h3>4. Choose appropriate clothing for your penguin.</h3>
							    <img src="images/rule4c.png" alt="" >
							    <p>Warning over clothing that could be inappropriate or insulting to others. Or if user shares personal information or has something inappropriate in the chat.</p>

							<h2>Rule Enforcement</h2>
							<p>
								If any of the Penguinators members or a fellow peer sees someone violate any of the rules, the consequence would be that their team loses 10 grade points. This would hopefully discourage anyone from thinking about breaking the rules because it would affect not only themselves but their team members as well.
							</p>
							<img src="images/happy.png" style="float:right; max-width: 50%">
							<h2>Human and Programming Factors</h2>
							<p>
								Participants will be given a run down up front of the rules of club penguin’s virtual space. Our team will verbally describe to each team our rules, as well as why each rule reflects implicit behavior that exists in the Club Penguin atmosphere. This will occur in the “Introduction” phase of our tour.
								<br><br>
								Participants will be given the chance to ask questions about the game world and it’s rules. Participants in the same team will also be able to help one another with the rules if need be. Because our rules are so explicit, we think that giving the participants a chance to respond and ask questions in this way will give us an idea how well they understand the rules.
								<br><br>
								Participants may ask us for help at any time, though we don’t foresee this being necessary. Part of the reason why we put everyone into large teams is so that teammates can help one another if need be. We expect that more experienced teammates will be able to support any teammates who are struggling with the tasks or rules, and will make it clear that supporting one another in this way is all part of the exercise!
								<br><br>
								The programming implications around our rule set are also fairly explicit. If participants swear in game, humans don’t actually need to do anything because the game will fully handle warning them in regards to the rule against swearing. Other programming factors are more implicit. Standing in front of another penguin is considered rude because it functionally blocks their character. This is hard coded into the game and results in a hint that it isn’t a very nice thing to do.
