							    <h3>1. Do not throw snowballs at other players' penguin avatars without their consent.</h3>
							    <img src="images/rule1.png" alt="" >
							    <p>Club Penguin users should be considerate and respectful of the avatars of other Club Penguin users while sharing the same virtual environment as them. Throwing snowballs at other penguins without their consent can be seen as unkind and disrespectful of another player’s avatar and personal space and may negatively influence their experience in the Club Penguin virtual world as well as create conflict. We don’t want to ruin another player’s fun.</p>
							</div>​

							<div class="content">
							    <h3>2. Don’t stand directly on, or cover up other penguins.</h3>
							    <img src="images/rule2.png" alt="" >
							    <p>Standing on or too close to other penguins is a breach of spacial awareness.  Users will be unable to see what their avatar is doing until they move to a new spot.  There is even a possibility that there could be pathing issues that hinder someone if they try to move from their location.  Another issue is an inability to distinguish someone else’s virtual presence (even after customization of their appearance/loadout), as both their avatar (and in the case of Club Penguin, their text chat) will be obscured.</p>
							</div>​

							<div class="content">
							    <h3>3. Refrain from using obscene or hurtful language in chat.</h3>
							    <img src="images/rule4a.png" alt="" >
							    <p>Whenever inappropriate language is used in Club Penguin, the chat is filtered, and the user is greeted with a pop-up as feedback reminding them of the rules. Even though the game has software limitations set in place to prevent it from appearing, such language can hurt the emotions of other users, make them uncomfortable, and ultimately make the game less fun for them. And even though we are college students, remember that Club Penguin aims to provide a safe environment for children, even providing an option to limit chat to predefined phrases.</p>
							</div>​

							<div class="content">
							    <h3>4. Choose appropriate clothing for your penguin.</h3>
							    <img src="images/rule4c.png" alt="" >
							    <p>The Club Penguin community values maintaining an environment where users of any background can log in and participate in a cohesive, safe environment.  Therefore, a warning will be given for wearing clothing that could be inappropriate or insulting to others.  The same goes with a user sharing personal information or saying something inappropriate in the chat, since it is necessary that people cater to the userbase, which in this case is rather diverse (and a fair amount of the userbase is made up of a younger audience).</p>

							<h2>Rule Enforcement</h2>
							<p>
								If any of the Penguinators members or a fellow peer sees someone violate any of the rules, the consequence would be that their team loses 10 grade points. This would hopefully discourage anyone from thinking about breaking the rules because it would affect not only themselves but their team members as well. We will give individuals who break the rules stern warnings about the consequences. The “group loses 10 grade points per rule broken” aspect will apply until the penalty reaches 30 points - at that point, only the actual individual who is breaking the rules will continue receiving the “10-point-per-rule” penalty. Penguinators members and other classmates will be asked to use the “Report” feature to report the individual if they continue breaking rules beyond the 30-point mark, which will result in the individual being booted from the game.

							<h2>Human and Programming Factors</h2>
							<p>
								Participants will be given a run down up front of the rules of club penguin’s virtual space. Our team will verbally describe to each team our rules, as well as why each rule reflects implicit behavior that exists in the Club Penguin atmosphere. This will occur in the “Introduction” phase of our tour.
								<br><br>
								Participants will be given the chance to ask questions about the game world and it’s rules. Participants in the same team will also be able to help one another with the rules if need be. Because our rules are so explicit, we think that giving the participants a chance to respond and ask questions in this way will give us an idea how well they understand the rules.
								<br><br>
								Participants may ask us for help at any time, though we don’t foresee this being necessary. Part of the reason why we put everyone into large teams is so that teammates can help one another if need be. We expect that more experienced teammates will be able to support any teammates who are struggling with the tasks or rules, and will make it clear that supporting one another in this way is all part of the exercise!
								<br><br>
								The programming implications around our rule set are also fairly explicit. If participants swear in game, humans don’t actually need to do anything because the game will fully handle warning them in regards to the rule against swearing. Other programming factors are more implicit. Standing in front of another penguin is considered rude because it functionally blocks their character. This is hard coded into the game and results in a hint that it isn’t a very nice thing to do.
