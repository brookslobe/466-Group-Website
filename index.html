										<h3>Background of Club Penguin</h3>
										<p>Club Penguin is a MMO (massively multiplayer online) game that was officially launched in October 2005 [1]. The game is primarily targeted towards children and preteens. Players interact with cartoon penguin avatars set in a winter-themed virtual world with various activities, such as playing games, chatting, building homes, and decorating with various accessories [2]. It is one of the most popular virtual worlds used by kids - as of 2013, over 200 million penguins have been created [3]. Unfortunately, Club Penguin is set to shut down on March 29, 2017 as the company is planning to release Club Penguin Island, a new game meant for mobile platforms in the same month [2].</p>

									<h3>Story/Narrative</h3>
									<p>Six penguins had recently moved into their new igloos in club penguin. Each of the penguins was excited to explore the world of club penguin and make new friends in the world.
									<br><br>
									The first penguin, Monquaz, decided she could make friends by visiting the igloos of people around her. The first igloo she visited was a random one she stumbled upon when visiting the igloo neighborhood. The igloo was fairly undecorated, like hers. She finally got to meet the owner of the igloo, a blue penguin named Pinguino. Pinguino mentioned that she was new to Club Penguin and that was why her house was not fully well done. They both connected over the fact that they were new to the area and decided to visit town together to make more friends.
									 <br><br>
									Entering town, both were excited seeing the coffee shop as both loved coffee. Upon entering the coffee shop they met a barista named Kefkiroth who greeted them warmly when they were ordering. While waiting for their order, they talked to and learned more about Kefkiroth, who was also fairly new to Club Penguin but had been there longer than they had. Kefkiroth invited them to a dance party he had heard was happening at the club that night. Excited, both Monquaz and Pinguino agreed to meet him there. They were excited to have made a new friend!
									<br><br>
									That night, Monquaz and Pinguino both made their way to the dance club in town for the dance party. Inside the glowing disco area, they met up with Kefkiroth and were introduced to his friends, Katkatkat27 and Therial. All 5 penguins conversed excitedly and decided to go join the avid dancers on the dance floor. They all enjoyed dancing for a while.
									<br><br>
									During the party, Kefkiroth and Therial decided to find the DJ to request some of their favorite music. They met the DJ, a penguin named Ginger879, and quickly learned that they all had similar music tastes. Kefkiroth invited Ginger879 to come join them on the dance floor when his shift ended, Ginger879 agreed and soon after, made his way to meet everyone on the dance floor. They all enjoyed dancing and talking during the entire party. 
									<br><br>
									At the end of the party, everyone was extremely hungry from the all the dancing. They all decided to hit the pizza place in the plaza. They made their way to the pizza parlour and ordered a bunch of pizzas. They all enjoyed talking and eating pizza together there.
									<br><br>
									Katkatkat27 said she had heard that the Ski Ramp was a really fun place to hang out and that they should all go sometime. They all excitedly agreed to go together and made plans to go the next day.
									<br><br>
									Meeting up bright and early at the ski hill, the group of penguins began to start sledding together and have races down the mountain. They all enjoyed sledding and then ended their fun day in the snow with a  large snowball fight in the area at the bottom of the mountain. They had all grown quite close at this point and decided to all explore Club Penguin together. Monquaz suggested they call themselves the “Penguinators” and all add each other as friends. They were all happy to have made friends and excited for the exciting adventures while exploring Club Penguin they knew they would have together in the near future.</p>
